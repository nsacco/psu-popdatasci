# Module 2 – Population Data Sources

Understanding where population data come from and how to assess their quality.

---

## Main Data Sources

- **Censuses**
  - Universal enumeration every 10 years  
  - Example: *Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas (Argentina, 2022)*  
- **Vital statistics**
  - Continuous registration of births and deaths (DEIS, UNData)
- **Surveys**
  - Representative samples (e.g. DHS, EPH, MICS)
- **Administrative data**
  - Registers, school, tax, and health systems

Each type balances coverage, frequency, and detail.

## Challenges in Population Data

- Coverage errors (undercounts, duplicates)

- Content errors (misreporting)

- Temporal gaps

- Access and harmonization

---

## Example: IPUMS-International

- Provides harmonized microdata from >100 countries

- Enables cross-national demographic analysis

- Metadata: https://international.ipums.org

### Practical Exercise

- Download a sample of Argentina 2010 from IPUMS

- Load in R:

```{r}

data <- read_ipums_micro("ipumsi_00001.dat.gz")
Tabulate population by sex, age, and province
```

### Discussion

- What makes population data “fit for purpose”?
- How do differences in collection design affect comparability?
